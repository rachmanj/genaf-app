## ⚠️ Technical Notes

1. **File Upload Security**:

    - Validate file types (PDF, PNG, JPG)
    - Limit file size (5MB max)
    - Store outside public root in production
    - Sanitize file names

2. **Status Management**:

    - Only allow valid status transitions
    - Prevent editing after approval
    - Track approval history in approver/approved_at fields

3. **Performance**:

    - Eager load relationships (employee, approver, documents)
    - Use DataTables server-side processing
    - Index database columns properly

4. **Security**:
    - CSRF protection on all forms
    - Permission checks on all actions
    - Validate all inputs
    - Sanitize file uploads
