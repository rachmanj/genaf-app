## Technical Recommendations

### Best Practices

-   Repository pattern for data access

-   Request classes for validation
-   Resource classes for API responses (if needed)
-   Observer classes for model events (e.g., notifications)
-   Policies for authorization
-   Laravel Pint for code formatting
-   PHPStan/Larastan for static analysis

### Performance Optimizations

-   Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
-   Database indexing on foreign keys, dates, status fields
-   Query caching for dashboard stats
-   Image optimization for uploads
-   Lazy loading for Livewire components

### Security Measures

-   CSRF protection (Laravel default)
-   SQL injection prevention (Eloquent)
-   XSS protection (Blade escaping)
-   File upload validation and sanitization
-   Rate limiting on forms
-   Password hashing (bcrypt)
-   Role-based access control

## Database Optimization

**Indexes**:

-   Foreign keys (user_id, vehicle_id, asset_id, etc.)
-   Status fields (for filtering)
-   Date fields (for reporting)
-   Document expiry dates (for alerts)

**Relations**:

-   One-to-Many: User→Requests, Vehicle→FuelRecords, Asset→Maintenances
-   Polymorphic: Notifications, Activity Logs (optional)
